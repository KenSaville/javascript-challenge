### Level 1: an Generated Automatic Table and Date Search to Search the table for UFO sighting data

Used and modified the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided.

Appended a table to web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Columns included `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

Used a date form and js code to listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

all seemed to work

Didn't do option 2
